This program randomly generates pass phrases by encoding the most common words according to
Google, in a Huffman tree, and then randomly picking left/right from the root to a word, and
printing the word.  The generated pass phrase is a valid encoding of the random bits, and thus
is provably strong, absent any bugs in the code.

To help generate more memorable pass phrases, users get a choice of two words at each step, but
we reduce the estimated bits by 1 as users are not likely to choose randomly.
